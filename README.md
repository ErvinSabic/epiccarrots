<p>This websites uses a microframework that I made in a weekend. Complete with routing, data managers, and a really bad templating engine that I wrote that uses regular expressions in PHP. Not my best work but hey, when you've got a weekend this is what you can come up with. Do what you want with it this was for a project where I was not allowed to use any PHP libraries. So I had to hand write everything.</p>
